## Mobile Project

### Instruction
The theme for this semester is **Food/Health/Energy**.

Develop a mobile application according to the theme assigned to you. The mobile 
application should contain the following components:

+ **A related icon to represent your application**
+ **A splash screen to be displayed when the application is launched**
+ **An about page to describe the application and developer**
+ **Some pages to present your application features**
+ **Include storage: File OR Database**

You are required to use **Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin (Windows)** or **Visual 
Studio 2019 and above for Mac (macOS)** as the development tool. The application to 
be developed should be written in a **Xamarin.Forms project** and can be deployed on 
Android, iOS, or both. For the database, if you are using local database, you need to 
use **SQLite**. If you are using online database, you need to use **Google Firebase**.

Your application must be original, not inherited or replicated from any existing 
application, not inherited from any Final Year Project, and it must be different from
each other.
